# EthioTelecomCDRAnalysis
Ethiotelecom is one of the giant network provider company located in Ethiopia. Due to increasing demands and infrastructure limitation the government has decided to outsource Ethiotelecom for additional network providers. Following this expansion, the company needs an intensive research on mobile pattern traffic analysis, spatiotemporal analysis of CDR (Call Detail Record) data, temporal correlation to extract mobile traffic pattern, developing generic data-driven resource allocation approach for cellular networks based on CDR activity levels etc.  Motivated by this, we perform Exploratory analysis and prediction selected features of  CDR data gained from Ethiotelecom. Thus, on the basis of temporal insights of total call duration, call fee and network download traffic, a framework has been proposed for mobile traffic pattern clustering. Moreover, timeseries  analysis and forecasting of CDR  features will be conducted soon.
